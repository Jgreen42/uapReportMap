# UFO Encounters Map

I developed this project over a span of several days and encountered numerous challenges, even with the assistance of GPT-4. The journey involved experimenting with various plugins, meticulously reviewing the code, and refining it for optimal performance. I strongly recommend using the scrubbed version of the dataset and hosting it locally within your application. This approach simplifies the process, as working with the dataset externally proved to be quite demanding. I'll be creating a separate README.md detailing the entire development process.

I'm genuinely proud of this creation. My fascination with the unknown dates back to my childhood, particularly with shows like "The X-Files." As kids, the mere sound of its theme song would send us into a frenzy, urging someone to switch it off immediately.

The advancements in technology, especially tools like GPT, have been instrumental in keeping me engaged with coding and understanding various procedures. It's essential to keep learning, practice regularly, and maintain a balanced approach. Recognize your strengths and areas of improvement. Currently, I work over 10 hours a day, six days a week. Engaging in projects like this serves as a therapeutic escape for me.

When using the data, exercise discretion and enjoy the exploration. I plan to enhance the mobile experience, especially regarding the display of encounter descriptions, which currently only appear on hover. Additionally, I aim to introduce a more user-friendly map tile for the night mode, an instructional key, and possibly a pop-up guide. Simplicity is key!

This interactive map displays reported UFO encounters across the United States. Users can explore individual reports, view clusters of reports in high-density areas, and switch between day and night modes.

## How to Read the Map

### 1. **Map Overview:**
- The map showcases reported UFO encounters across the United States.

### 2. **Color-coded Markers:**
- Markers on the map are color-coded based on the duration of the UFO encounter.
- The color intensity indicates the length of the encounter, with more intense colors representing longer durations.

### 3. **Viewing Details:**
- **Hover over a Marker:** By hovering over any marker, a tooltip will appear showing detailed information about the encounter. This includes the date, city, state, shape of the UFO, and duration of the encounter in seconds.

### 4. **Clustered Markers:**
- In areas with a high density of reported encounters, markers are clustered together.
- The number on the cluster indicates how many reports are within that cluster.
- **Click on a Cluster:** To view individual reports within a cluster, click on it. The cluster will break apart to show individual markers.

### 5. **Dark Mode:**
- Enhance your viewing experience by switching to dark mode. Click the "Toggle Dark Mode" button located at the top right corner of the map.
